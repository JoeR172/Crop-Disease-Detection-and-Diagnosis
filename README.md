Website (Joseph Reese): Website coded in React JS, using Google Firebase as a development platorm and for deployment. To run loacally use "npm start" in the terminal. "npm run build" and "firebase deploy" 
will rebuild and deploy the website to the web. This has, of course, been done already pre-Final Demo. The website may be visited at any time at the URL: https://crop-diagnosis-detector.web.app 
The use of the machine learning model is limited to when the Raspberry Pi it is hosted on is plugged in and running, however, this was an added requirement during 403 by our sponsor at the time, Sambandh, 
for the machine learning subsystem. 

Mobile App (Aniketh Bharadwaj): The mobile app was coded in React Native and Expo, and also uses Google Firebase for backend development, including Authentication and Storage. In order to run the app, please ensure that React Native, Expo, and Node.js are installed. Once the required dependencies are installed, navigate to the root folder of the application code, and run "npx expo start" in the terminal. This will open a localhost session with Metro Bundler and a QR code will appear. Scan the QR code with your mobile device and follow instructions to start using the app.
